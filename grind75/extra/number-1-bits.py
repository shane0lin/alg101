# 191. Number of 1 Bits
# Easy
# Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).
# Note: Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, the input will be given as a signed integer type. It should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.
# In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using 2's complement notation. Therefore, in Example 3, the input represents the signed integer. -3.
# Example 1:
# Input: n = 00000000000000000000000000001011
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000000001011 has a total of three '1' bits.
# Example 2:
# Input: n = 00000000000000000000000010000000
# Output: 1
# Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000010000000 has a total of one '1' bit.
# Example 3:
# Input: n
