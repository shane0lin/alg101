# Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).
# A valid BST is defined as follows:
# The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
# The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
# Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
